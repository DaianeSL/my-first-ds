# My First Design System

Welcome to my first design system project! ðŸŽ‰ This project is built using modern tools to ensure a smooth development experience and scalability. Here's what I used:

## Tools and Technologies
- **Vite**: For fast and optimized development.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.
- **Storybook**: For building and testing UI components in isolation.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
npm install
```

### Running the Project

```bash
npm run dev
npm run storybook
```

### Building the Project
To build the design system for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## What's Next?
This is my first step into creating a reusable design system. I'll be adding more components, documentation, and tests as I learn and improve. ðŸš€
